To do list

app.js that works with index.html are from https://code-maven.com/todo-in-html-and-javascript
My version is app2.js that works with index2.html. It uses the same css file.
This app just gets what user inputs, creates list items and show them on the html, adds the red linethrough class when user clicks on an item and removes the red linethrough class when user clicks again.
It doesn't save the items on the localStorage.
